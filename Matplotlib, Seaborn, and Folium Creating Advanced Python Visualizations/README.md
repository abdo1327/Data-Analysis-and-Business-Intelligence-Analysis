# Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium Creating Advanced Python Visualizations

## Introduction
This project aimed to analyze historical automobile sales data to understand trends during recession periods. Various visualizations were created using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium to gain insights into sales performance, advertising expenditure, GDP variation, and the impact of unemployment rates.

## Visualizations Created
1. **Line Chart for Automobile Sales Over Time**
   - Analyzes the trend of automobile sales over time.
   - Purpose: To understand historical sales performance and identify trends.

2. **Line Plot Comparing Sales of Different Vehicle Types**
   - Compares sales trends of different vehicle types during recession and non-recession periods.
   - Purpose: To determine variations in sales performance across vehicle types during economic downturns.

3. **Line Plot Analyzing the Effect of Unemployment Rate on Vehicle Type and Sales**
   - Examines the relationship between the unemployment rate and vehicle type sales during recession periods.
   - Purpose: To investigate the influence of unemployment on vehicle sales.

4. **Map Showing Highest Sales Regions/Offices During Recession**
   - Visualizes geographic areas with the highest sales performance during recession periods.
   - Purpose: To understand the distribution of sales across different regions or offices during economic downturns.

## Inference
- The line chart for automobile sales over time revealed a noticeable decline during recession periods.
- Sales trends varied across different vehicle types during recession periods, with certain types being more affected than others.
- There was a correlation between the unemployment rate and vehicle type sales during recession periods.
- The map visualization highlighted regions or offices with the highest sales performance during economic downturns.

## Conclusion
Through the creation of various visualizations, this project provided valuable insights into historical automobile sales data during recession periods. These insights can aid stakeholders in understanding sales trends, identifying areas for improvement, and making informed business decisions.
