## Collecting Job Data Using APIs

### Dataset Used in this Assignment
The dataset used in this lab comes from the following source: [Jobs on Naukri.com](https://www.kaggle.com/promptcloud/jobs-on-naukricom) under the Public Domain license.

## Survey Dataset Exploration Lab

In this part of the project, the focus is on:
- Load the dataset from the given URL which will be used for the next part of the project.
- Explore the dataset.
- Get familiar with the data types.

## Web Scraping

In this part of the project, the focus is on:
- Extract information from a given website.
- Write the scraped data into a CSV file to be used later.

## Data Wrangling

In this part of the project, the focus is on:
- Identify duplicate values in the dataset.
- Remove duplicate values from the dataset.
- Identify missing values in the dataset.
- Impute the missing values in the dataset.
- Normalize data in the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this part of the project, the focus is on:
- Identify the distribution of data in the dataset.
- Identify outliers in the dataset.
- Remove outliers from the dataset.
- Identify correlation between features in the dataset.

## Data Visualization

In this part of the project, the focus is on:
- Visualize the distribution of data.
- Visualize the relationship between two features.
- Visualize composition of data.
- Visualize comparison of data.

##  Key findings & Implications (Refer to Dashboard for visualizing the data created by Congo IBM.pdf )
- There have been significant changes in the rank order between the two years.Oracle is expected to drop out of the top 10 next year.
- PostgreSQL is expected to become the most popular database system. This could be attributed to its open-source nature and ease of use compared to some other databases.
- The Python language, along with languages associated with full-stack development, is holding the top position in the current year, and this trend is expected to continue in the near future. However, some of the most popular back-end languages, such as PHP,  and C++ are anticipated to drop out of the top 10.
- Python is gaining more prominence, moving from the 5th to the 3rd position. This may be attributed to its widespread usage and simplicity.
- Full-stack languages (both front and back end) are at the top, indicating a strong necessity for their applications.
