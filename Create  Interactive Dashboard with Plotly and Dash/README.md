# Automobile Sales Statistics Dashboard

This repository contains code for an interactive dashboard created using Dash, a Python framework for building analytical web applications. The dashboard visualizes historical automobile sales data, allowing users to select between two types of reports: "Yearly Statistics" and "Recession Period Statistics."

## Overview

The provided code consists of:

- Loading historical automobile sales data from a CSV file.
- Initializing the Dash app.
- Creating dropdown menus for selecting the type of report and the year.
- Defining callback functions to update the input container (year dropdown) based on the selected statistics and to plot the output graphs for the selected report type.
- Structuring the layout of the dashboard using HTML components.
- Displaying relevant visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts for analyzing automobile sales trends over time and during recession periods.

## Installation

To run the dashboard locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Python script using `python Create Dashboard with Plotly and Dash.py`.
4. Access the dashboard in your web browser at the specified URL (typically http://127.0.0.1:8050/).

## Usage

Once the dashboard is running, you can interact with it by selecting the desired report type and year from the dropdown menus. The dashboard will update to display the relevant visualizations based on your selections.
